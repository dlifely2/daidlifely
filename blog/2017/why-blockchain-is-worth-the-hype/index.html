Whether it will reach its potential or just be a passing fad like VR is yet to be seen.</p> <h4>What even is a blockchain?</h4> <p>For those unfamiliar with the details surrounding blockchain, I would recommend listening to Tim Ferriss’ <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/06/04/nick-szabo/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">podcast</a> with <a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.co.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nick Szabo</a>. They cover a huge amount of cryptocurrency content, from beginner to advanced. Szabo’s analogy of a blockchain has really stuck in my mind. He compares a blockchain to a ‘fly getting trapped in amber’. Explaining that as more time passes the fly becomes more and more trapped until eventually there are so many layers of transparent amber over it that it can not possibly be removed and all can see it.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tgh9Y9PThE5R6c3dyiXpSg.jpeg"><figcaption>Fly Stuck in Amber</figcaption></figure> <p>Each additional layer of amber represents a block and these blocks accumulate to form a chain of blocks - hence Blockchain. The deeper the fly is, the less probable it can move or change. This fly is a metaphor for a transaction, this could be the movement of bitcoin or the rights to a piece of land. And thus, the more transactions that have happened since yours the more securely ‘baked in’ yours will be. The whole system is entirely transparent and secure.</p> <h4>Okay, but why does this matter for society?</h4> <p>It is clear to see how this idea could be applied to businesses for tracking the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cryptocurrency</a> or the <a href="http://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2017/jun/blockchain-the-backbone-of-digital-supply-chains.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">supply chain</a> or for <a href="https://medium.com/@LetsTalkPayments/21-companies-leveraging-blockchain-for-identity-management-and-authentication-d09d88e3a4bf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">digital identity</a> but how does this differ from any other marginal technological improvement?</p> <p>Blockchain is fundamentally different from today’s system of records as it is decentralised. Meaning that instead of relying on the integrity of an institution to keep records of transactions, every single stakeholder holds the same exact record. The record is compared and updated on everyone’s ledger. Meaning that no one person can alter the record fraudulently.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0wqKBWF5jHwFZqyOFWYQ3g.png"><figcaption>Interpersonal Trust Attitudes.

Of course one cannot infer causation or directionality from this without further analysis however. It is at the very least indicative of a pattern. Unfortunately there is little data for subsaharan Africa in this sample. Although the few countries that are present (Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia etc) present some of the lowest levels of trust in others in the world.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qLDHf6D6ULMYdc53bNM9jw.png"><figcaption>Esteban Ortiz-Ospina and Max Roser (2017) — ‘Trust’. <em>Published online at OurWorldInData.org.</em> Retrieved from: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trust" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://ourworldindata.org/trust</a></figcaption></figure> <p>The mass adoption of an efficient and secure blockchain system for contracts would increase societies’ institutional quality to unprecedented levels and kickstart development in previously held back areas. For example, the solidification of property rights will allow individuals to take out loans by remortgaging their properties and thus using leverage to finance new ventures. This would help to lift local communities out of poverty while contributing to the economy. Or the implementation of blockchain in the academic credentials will remove all problems of fake degrees. Or most famously, the use of bitcoin to remove the centralised control of currency from an incompetent central bank or government. Once stabilised, this could potentially prevent issues of hyperinflation or massive depreciations. These examples demand a whole article for themselves so I will not go into too much detail now.</p> <p><strong>I could go on and on about the genius of blockchain but the main takeaway is this: society no longer needs to rely on one record keeper and thus trust in the state or other stakeholders is no longer essential.</strong></p> <p>Trust in institutions has held back developing countries and thus the implementation of blockchain could potentially help these same countries vastly improve their futures. Looking at the data it is clear that there is a strong positive correlation between trust and GDP per capita.</p> <p>Please follow along if you enjoyed this article.
