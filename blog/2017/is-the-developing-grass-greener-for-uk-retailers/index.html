These chains face a bleak macroeconomic outlook within the UK with rising business rates, inflation, depreciation of sterling, rising commodity costs and increasing pension burdens. Furthermore, with Brexit negotiations still underway, many retailers remain worried about the potential of labour costs rising.</p> <p>Developing countries could offer a kind of oasis for these retails, but some have found this to be a mirage. When thinking about going international, many retailers will naturally think to enter through a physical presence — as after-all this is how they got started here?This could prove fool hardy however, as the high fixed costs increase the potential risk. M&amp;S’ exit from China is a clear example of how different cultures shop in different ways and entering them can be tricky.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*upCLd3OnWW_nSp0EAMJIcQ.png"></figure> <p>AT Kearny’s annual Retail Development report suggests that India and China are the top two untapped markets for international retail ambitions. Both with enormous fragmented markets present as large a challenge as opportunity! Costco and Lidl have entered China in a far more fitting way however, by entering through a pure online play. It has been shown in fact that these ‘developing’ countries are in fact ahead of ‘developed’ countries in their shopping strategies. Mobile purchases outpace in-store purchasing in these countries when compared to western developed countries.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*j-elWq7UfGlqIIXLjxe8kQ.png"></figure> <p>Furthermore, India’s mobile shopping has grown 121% and China’s 192% over the past year alone. WeChat (A popular Chinese Messaging App) has built in purchasing, completely normalising the mobile process. You have to look no further than Alibaba’s success (Over $25bn) with singles day to understand the power of m-commerce in China. This all goes to show that a well executed e-commerce and m-commerce entry into Pacific Asia could secure the next decade of growth for domestic giants looking to expand overseas.</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=bc1e9f4516c" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
