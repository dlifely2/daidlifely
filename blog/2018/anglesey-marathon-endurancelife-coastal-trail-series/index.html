After graduating in June last year I decided I wanted to use my year off to do something I had always wanted to do: <strong>Run a marathon</strong>.</p> <p>Isobel wrote this great piece on the day itself.</p> <p>Well, it went a bit like this:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sjWeoKZfqjQQ5a7m."><figcaption><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/david-lifely-ics" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/david-lifely-ics</a></figcaption></figure> <p>05:45 — Alarm goes off. Snooze.</p> <p>06:00 — Get up.</p> <p>06:45 — Leave the hotel.</p> <p>07:30 — Register.</p> <p>08:30 — Race begins!</p> <p>The clock starts and over 100 marathon and ultra-marathon runners (plus a few dog companions) set off towards Holyhead Mountain. Running quickly turned to walking as queues formed to pass through gates and begin the scramble up the initial 200m elevation.</p> <p>The higher we climbed, the more spectacular the views of the sunrise over the ocean became. But I couldn’t look for too long without losing my footing on the slippery rocks!</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*82qMI-42DH6DFVox."><figcaption>Not my photos as my phone was packed away safely in my bag.</figcaption></figure> <p>Descending the mountain again (arguably harder than ascending at this point), Dave and I came into the first checkpoint feeling strong. There was one checkpoint every 6 miles where marshalls happily provided a mountain of jelly babies — very helpful for motivation but not for nutrition strategies.</p> <p>The route follows the coastal path around Anglesey Island. In the initial bay, the sea was calm and there was no wind, I even considered taking my jacket off.</p> <p>We then turned a corner and were hit in the face by strong winds and lashings of rain. And the mud began.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/774/0*Rtzib3mj7p63xPW6."></figure> <p>We crossed waterlogged fields but still had nice views to our right to distract from the pain, wet and cold in our legs.</p> <p>Small sections of road provided much needed relief although there was very little flat ground to be seen. The constant rolling of up-and-down took more out of our legs than we realised. All the runners around us stopped to walk these hills but we ran them — only for some to overtake us again a few kilometres later when our legs were cramping up.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RiNpMOId8FmyKGUi."></figure> <p>**Gore-tex shoes were a great decision — I highly recommend Inov8 Roclite GTX**</p> <p>After the third checkpoint, we had reached the southerly most part of our run and it was time to head inland and back towards the finish line.</p> <p>However, this did not mean the last 15k would be easy.</p> <p>We headed through fields of sheep, rams, horses and trudged through an actual pig-sty… Which led us to wonder why we didn’t enter a calm, flat, road race.</p> <p>Soon after this thought, we both got stuck halfway to our knees in a bog! Keeping both shoes on my feet became the next challenge.</p> <p>After this, we decided to adopt the strategy of the more experienced trail runners around us and just walk up the hills…</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8VCqR1gIYaQpYPmR."><figcaption>Very happy to see our ‘support team’ with chocolate!</figcaption></figure> <p>In one section, the muddy hill up was so slippery I had to choose between sliding down again or grabbing onto the barbed wire fence for support. (I chose barbed wire, it was the wrong decision #RIPIsobel’sHand).</p> <p>Other sections had 5-step high wooden styles just to make it that extra bit harder for our legs and the dogs.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/780/0*HjBztw4RKoeEVBJR."><figcaption>Balancing Act</figcaption></figure> <p>The last 10k seemed to last forever — every time I looked at my watch there seemed to still be 10k to go!</p> <p>Eventually, we reached the bottom of Holyhead Mountain for the second time. With Dave striding on ahead, I clambered up the slope which had a max gradient of 38% (according to Strava).</p> <p>Upon reaching the top, we saw an amazing sight. Not the oceanic views. Nor the lighthouse. But the sign ‘ONE MILE TO GO’.</p> <p>So after glancing at each other silently, we set off at full pelt down the mountain — again! With another two runners hot on our heels, we overtook numerous runners who had adopted a more cautious approach to descending.</p> <p>And we were finished!</p> <p>Crossing the line in 5 hours 50 mins, we came 30th and 31st out of 61 runners. (Dave very kindly let me check in first).</p> <p>Isobel: 8th female out of 22.</p> <p>Dave: 23rd male out of 39.</p> <p>Overall, an extremely muddy and challenging event for your first marathon but I would highly recommend it. The EnduranceLife events are well organised and the changes in terrain and scenery meant you were never bored!</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TmliyNthXmoWWoa9."></figure> <p>If you’re interested in signing up: <a href="https://www.endurancelife.com/anglesey" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.endurancelife.com/anglesey</a></p> <p>Or in sponsoring us: <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/david-lifely-ics" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/david-lifely-ics</a></p> <p>My Strava route: <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1354967213" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.strava.com/activities/1354967213</a></p> <p>Photo credits: <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1355650892" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.strava.com/activities/1355650892</a> / <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1354920095" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.strava.com/activities/1354920095</a></p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=fec2875c3c10" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
