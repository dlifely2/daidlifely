As shown below, this can already be seen in some markets. However, firms use differing market definitions to shape competitive narrative to their advantage.</p> <p>For example, no-one would argue against Google’s dominance in the search engine market, but one could argue Google is not dominant in the digital advertising space. Instead, Google and Facebook hold a duopoly over this specific market. It is well known that the more dominant a company is, the more they will downplay their significance by defining their market segment extremely broadly thus downplaying their power. On the other hand however, start-ups and less successful businesses will narrowly define their markets in order to show great success and dominance. It is important to keep an eye on these definitions.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2PUuvSsBfnzIsuvSy3ut9g.png"><figcaption><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/</a></figcaption></figure> <p>This graphic is not truly representative of the situation, however, because it defines social media platforms by service, not by firm. A more illuminating graph is shown below. This clearly describes the monopolistic situation as it stands globally. The West is dominated by Facebook, and Tencent dominates China. In the west, Facebook’s main competition is Snap. Google’s YouTube does not offer a comparable user proposition. Facebook’s Instagram has been aggressively fighting Snap over the past year, by introducing the Instagram stories function and heavily promoting similar products within Facebook too.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/626/1*sD-G0b8nkUGcKXoD-2jTfw.png"></figure> <p>Monopolies create all sorts of problems, and I am certainly not going to cover them all here. The economics literature has a rich literature discussing various theory around the implications of monopoly firms.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jLMwBjWt5-o7Gk6zgSOlqQ.png"><figcaption>Facebook’s dominance in social, <a href="https://twitter.com/gearoidorourke" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/gearoidorourke</a></figcaption></figure> <p>The issue of innovation is the traditional argument against tech monopolies. Schumpeter believed that holding a large market share is an incentive to innovate, in order to reap the rewards. Schumpeter believed that the greatest innovations are also prohibitively expensive for smaller firms and thus only large dominant firms can truly drive innovation forward. The opposing view is best attributed to Hayek, who argued that <em>competition</em> is necessary to incentivise firms to innovate, such that a monopoly has no incentive at all. Although this is an important discussion, I would rather focus on the specifics of the network-based consumer monopoly, as this covers issues not seen before.</p> <p>Aggregators are successful by owning the consumer relationship at scale. This means their powerful position is dependent on successfully maintaining this relationship, through good customer service or, alternatively, high switching costs. Traditional monopolies exhibited monopolistic behaviour by controlling and restricting supply, or through access to extract rent. Under the US antitrust laws, aggregators will remain untouched as they grow into their monopoly status, as long as no ‘harm’ is coming to the consumer through ‘monopolising’ behaviour. US legislation does not seek to punish firms for simply succeeding where others could not. The EU Competition Authorities take a different tact and instead protect the ideal of competition itself, rather than the explicit customers it serves.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KAQP1gCQiuwBybDIuG17gQ.png"><figcaption>Opening sequence from HBO’s hit comedy ‘Silicon Valley’</figcaption></figure> <p>The Atlantic divide in antitrust legislation could cause major problems for ambitious tech startups and their global expansions. At the very least, this policy is likely to further strengthen America’s (Silicon Valley’s) tech dominance over Europe. Many interpret the EU’s approach as ‘anti-tech’. The EU fined Google €2.42bn for distorting Google Shopping popularity and demoting competing price comparison services. Interestingly, Margrethe Vestager compared Google to a road-infrastructure firm that had started a new bus service and was blocking off road access to competing bus companies. This stark comparison reveals how the EU does not plan to reinvent existing legislation for the digital age, but instead, holding internet-based companies to the same rules and regulations as monopolists in the past. This ruling outlawed dominant players from favouring their own adjacent products or services. It is still unclear what this ruling will mean for other aggregators that have similar adjacent businesses.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/1*TbSa2lrMtAV0l1vQ5snW0A.png"></figure> <p>It is true that these new tech monopolies are not the same beasts of the past. But digital singularity is not all roses and sunshine either. The consumer is paying for these services, whether they like it or not, just not with money but with their data. These online giants have been collecting our data for years with increasing sophistication and application. We are (un)wittingly supplying these platforms with trillions of data-points for whatever use they see fit. This gives companies like Facebook disproportionate power to influence us with intelligent algorithms uniquely targeting each individual user. In this digital age, data is the new oil and these firms are the new oligarchs.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/780/1*wn_DrLiXlD8veiK3mkzALQ.png"><figcaption>Donald Trump, Fox News</figcaption></figure> <p>I will now leave you with one final thought regarding the harm consumers are coming to due to a lack of competition in the social media market. Fake News. 2017 was plagued by it and social media bots disrupting and influencing elections across the globe. It is clear that nation states… Russia…. have weaponised bots to meddle in foreign democracies. It is also clear that the tech giants are, at the very least, complicit in this. Fantastic work at the Oxford Internet Institute has rigorously investigated the impact of bots in these elections and can be found here (<a href="http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/</a>). I understand that companies such as Facebook and YouTube cannot physically check each and every piece of content loaded to the site or validate the identity of every user. For example, 300 hours of footage is uploaded to YouTube every minute! Even machine learning cannot sift through that amount of unstructured data quick enough. Yet, at least. But what these companies can do is honestly and wholeheartedly cooperate with academics to study, analyse and solve these fundamental problems. Without significant competitive or legislative pressure, these firms are not incentivised to do so.</p> <p><strong>*Disclaimer:</strong> This article is intentionally biased to provoke thoughts around the harm aggregation in big tech. I appreciate aggregation leads to other great things that are not possible in a fragmented market.</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9f78eaa9e40d" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
