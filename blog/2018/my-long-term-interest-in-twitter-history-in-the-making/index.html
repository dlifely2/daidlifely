Facebook has 6.6x more active users than Twitter and Instagram have 2.4x more. However, Twitter serves a different purpose to other platforms. Twitter is a better place to share ideas and opinions in an open off-the-cuff kind of way. Twitter is also examinable and open to academics to study.</p> <p>I remember sitting in a History lesson learning about Chairman Mao’s cult of personality and postulating how interesting it would have been to scroll through his twitter feed and to hear his immediate reactions and opinions to the now pivotal moments in history. What would Mao have said to his followers during the Long March, defended his infidelity against He Zizhen or how would it have altered his Cultural Revolution? You could argue these thoughts are evidence of a lazy millennial school boy that wanted quick answers. But none-the-less in the future historians will be pouring over tweets, checking the relative timings and what over prominent people of the time were saying. Since Trump has taken office, this no longer seems at all farfetched as whole news programmes discuss his latest tweets as a matter of routine.</p> <p>The Arab Spring is still the most prominent example of social media allowing people to band together against an oppressor as a collective and make a real change. In 2010, people were palpably optimistic about social media as a force for good in the world. Although this view is less prominent now, it has continued to be an open platform for discussion and dissemination of ideas. The #BlackLivesMatter movement has been tweeted and retweeted millions of times and has brought the conversation to the front of everyone’s feeds. More recently the #MeToo movement has helped bring a voice to those that were powerless and without a platform to stand up. This is only the beginning, social media is democratising information by giving a voice to the masses.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*abPTGdGeo-Fc9vGF-b5jEA.png"><figcaption>Frequency of Tweets in Egypt over time, the two spikes representing the resignation of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak — when he resigned and when he didn’t.

Skepticism here is fair:</p> <h3>Keith Urbahn on Twitter</h3> <p>So I'm told by a reputable person they have killed Osama Bin Laden. Hot damn.</p> <h3>Bana Alabed on Twitter</h3> <p>My name is Bana, I'm 7 years old. I am talking to the world now live from East #Aleppo. This is my last moment to either live or die. - Bana</p> <h3>Matthew Gertz on Twitter</h3> <p>The president just threatened a nuclear strike while live-tweeting a Fox News segment. Left, Fox, 7:37 pm Right, Trump, 7:49 pm</p> <p>There are many other interesting and revealing tweets I could display here to further illustrate my point, but I believe twitter has because such a popular source that I do not need to persuade anyway of its importance. I have written this article to give a different perspective on the conservation around the indelible records we now leave of ourselves on the internet. All too often people view this as a something to be fearful of. Instead, if we take the long view of (10–300 years) we can see this micro-blogging tendency as a catalyst for understanding and heightened historical knowledge. It might even stop history repeating itself — quite as much.</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5215533d82d" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
